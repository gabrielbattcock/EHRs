This R script contains all the EHR practical sessions for the module.

# Preliminary work: Import and clean data {.unnumbered}

This short section installs and loads the key packages to be used and
reads in the datasets. Please run this code before the course starts and
ensure it all runs (up to the statement: "You are now ready to start the
practical sessions").

## Data

The data used in these practicals are artificial data. Using artificial
data allows us to access and analyse the data more freely. Real
electronic health record data are, as we would expect, tightly protected
and would not allow you to get such hands-on experience in the same way.

*We will act as if these data were real during the practicals, but
please do not draw any clinical conclusions from these data!*

We have endeavoured to make these data as realistic as possible. The
structure - dataset names, variable names and variable types - are
inspired by real data. We have attempted to ensure that key correlation
structures and relationships are respected within the data. However,
simulated data are never quite as complex as real data. So please do
bear in mind that these data are artificial. Let us know if you find any
flaws or confusing aspects!

Before you start, download the data and codelists as per the
instructions provided. Create a folder that will be your working
directory for this module (i.e. the folder in which you store the data
and codelists, perform analyses and save results). Put all the data in a
folder called "Sample", within your new module folder. Put all the
codelists in a folder called "Codelists" in the same folder. Store the
.Rmd files in this new module folder.

The data consist of 7 datasets (Patient, Consultations, Clinical,
Therapy, Additional, IMD and Death). The dataset names have a prefix of
"Sim\_" to remind us that these data are simulated. The picture below
shows how the different datasets link together and what variables each
dataset contains. The red font indicates unique the unique identifier
within a dataset, if one exists.

![Figure 1. Structure of artificial data](Data_structure.png)

The datasets you have been provided with have a suffix of "\_sample",
e.g. "Sim_Patient_sample.csv", as a reminder that you have been given a
small sample of the full data extract (the artificial data contain a
much larger number of patients, as is typical of these sorts of data; we
have sampled a smaller number to make the analyses manageable for the
practical sessions).

### The Patient file

This artificial dataset contains basic details about relevant patients.
We are going to imagine that we have been provided with data in response
to a request for a data extract. We have been provided with data for
relevant patients. The relevant patients for our research question (as
we will see below) are those who had a prescription for one of two
classes of drug (proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H2-receptor antagonist
(H2RA)), with their first such prescription being after their 18th
birthday and between the dates 1 January 1991 and 17 April 2017.
Further, we have only received data for patients who are deemed to have
acceptable quality data.

All other datasets are restricted to patients in this datafile.

The variables contained in the patient file are shown in the table
below.

| Variable  |  Format   | Description                                               | Levels                                           |
|-----------|:---------:|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| patid     | numerical | Patient's identifier                                      |                                                  |
| pracid    | numerical | General practitioner                                      |                                                  |
| gender    | numerical | Patient's sex                                             | Male, Female                                     |
| eth5      | numerical | Ethnicity (5 categories)                                  | White, South-Asian, Black, Mixed, Other, Unknown |
| yob       | numerical | Year of birth                                             |                                                  |
| crd       |   date    | Date the patient's current registration began             |                                                  |
| tod       |   date    | Date the patient transferred out of practice, if relevant |                                                  |
| deathdate |   date    | Date of death                                             |                                                  |
| accept    | indicator | Acceptable data quality                                   | 1=acceptable, 0=not acceptable                   |

### The Deprivation file

This artificial dataset contains patient- and practice-level measures of
deprivation, specifically the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD).

| Variable   |  Format   | Description                                  | Levels                                         |
|------------|:---------:|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| patid      | numerical | Patient's identifier                         |                                                |
| pracid     | numerical | General practitioner                         |                                                |
| imd_person | numerical | Index of Multiple Deprivation, patient level | Least Deprived (1), 2, 3, 4, Most Deprived (5) |

### The Death file

This artificial dataset contains details of death for relevant patients
(i.e. patients who died in the relevant time period). This dataset
mimics an externally linked source of death data, e.g. from the Office
for National Statistics.

| Variable  |  Format   | Description                          |
|-----------|:---------:|--------------------------------------|
| patid     | numerical | Patient's identifier                 |
| deathdate |   date    | Date of death                        |
| death_inj | indicator | Death due to non-communicable causes |
| death_nc  | indicator | Death due to non-communicable causes |
| death_com | indicator | Death due to communicable causes     |
| death     | indicator | All-cause mortality indicator        |

We therefore have two stored dates of death - one internal to the
database and one obtained through linkage to external data. The channels
used to obtain this information is different for the two dates, thus it
is possible for a recorded date of death to differ for the same person,
in the two datasets. This is a common feature of such routinely
collected data.

### The Consultations file

This artificial dataset contains basic details of the consultations that
each patient had. These are largely consultations with the general
practitioner (at the GP surgery, on the telephone or at the patient's
home, for example), but there are some entries with brief details of
consultations at hospitals, accident and emergency, or other third
parties.

| Variable  |  Format   | Description             | Levels                                                                                          |
|-----------|:---------:|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| consid    | indicator | Consultation identifier |                                                                                                 |
| patid     | numerical | Patient's identifier    |                                                                                                 |
| eventdate |   date    | Date of event           |                                                                                                 |
| constype  | numerical | Consultation type       | Symptom, Examination, Diagnosis, Intervention, Management, Administration, Presenting complaint |

### The Clinical file

This artificial dataset contains details of clinical measurements taken
during relevant consultations. Note that this file only contains
information relevant to our question. Typically a much wider range of
clinical events and measurements are available in this domain.

Further, for clinical events contained within the data we have
restricted the size and complexity of this dataset by including only the
first recording. For example, for chronic conditions such as diabetes,
this dataset only contains the first relevant mention. In real data,
there might be multiple repeated entries related to that diabetes
diagnosis.

| Variable  |  Format   | Description                    | Levels                             |
|-----------|:---------:|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| patid     | numerical | Patient's identifier           |                                    |
| eventdate |   date    | Date of event                  |                                    |
| sysdate   |   date    | Date event entered into system |                                    |
| constype  | numerical | Focus of consultation          | See consultation type list         |
| consid    | numerical | Consultation identifier        |                                    |
| medcode   | numerical | Medical code                   | See medical code (medcode) list    |
| enttype   | numerical | Type of entity                 | See entity type list               |
| adid      | numerical | Acceptable data quality        | 0=no additional data; ID otherwise |

You have been provided with a text file "Lists.txt", which contains
lists for consultation type and entity type. We have not provided you
with a list of medcodes (medical codes), since there are an awful lot of
them. Each clinical codelist (see below) contains a list of medical
codes and a text description of each code in the list. We will find out
more about the purpose of the medical codes and codelists later.

### The Therapy file

This artificial dataset contains details about prescriptions provided
during relevant consultations.

Please note that the dose, quantity and strength data are not hugely
sophisticated in these artificial data; patterns and relationships
likely to be present in real data may not be reflected in these
variables.

| Variable   |  Format   | Description             | Levels                           |
|------------|:---------:|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| patid      | numerical | Patient's identifier    |                                  |
| eventdate  |   date    | Date of event           |                                  |
| prodcode   | numerical | Product code            | See product code (prodcode) list |
| consid     | numerical | Consultation identifier |                                  |
| qty        | numerical | Quantity prescribed     |                                  |
| daily_dose | numerical | Estimated daily dose    |                                  |
| strength   |  string   | Substance strength      |                                  |

Similarly to the medical codes in the Clinical file, we have not
provided you with a list of all prodcodes (product codes). Each drug
codelist (see below) contains a list of product codes, with a text
description. We will find out more about the purpose of the product
codes and codelists later.

### The Additional file

This artificial dataset contains additional details about the clinical
events in the Clinical datafile. This additional information is
typically continuous measurements, such as weight, height, BMI, serum
creatinine, pulse, etc. It also typically includes information such as
details of smoking and alcohol consumption.

This dataset has been simplified to contain only additional data on
height, weight, BMI, smoking and alcohol. In reality, a datafile like
this would contain data on a much wider range of measurements and
information.

| Variable |  Format   | Description                | Levels                   |
|----------|:---------:|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| adid     | numerical | Additional data identifier |                          |
| patid    | numerical | Patient's identifier       |                          |
| enttype  | numerical | Type of entity             | See entity type list     |
| data1    | numerical | First data entry           | See additional data list |
| data2    | numerical | Second data entry          | See additional data list |
| data3    | numerical | Third data entry           | See additional data list |

You have been provided with a text file "Lists.txt", which contains the
entity type list and the additional data list.

### Codelists

There are 30 codelists. Most, but not all, of these are real codelists
that were developed for published studies. They are more complex than
the data at hand requires, but we have left most of the codelists in
their original form to give you a sense of how complex these can be. We
will explore the codelists more, particularly in the second practical
session.

Most of the codelists are for clinical events, and contain medical codes
(`medcodes`) and their text description. The others are drug codelists;
these contain product codes (`prodcodes`) and their text description.

## The research question

Throughout the practical sessions, we will be focusing on the question
of whether proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) increase subsequent all-cause
mortality. We will compare patients prescribed PPIs to those prescribed
another class of drugs, H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA).

This question was addressed in real data by Jeremy Brown et al
[(published paper
here)](https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bcp.14728).
The data we are using have been simulated to resemble the data used in
that paper as closely as possible.

In order to address this question, it is useful to have a little
knowledge of the two drug classes of interest.

### PPIs and H2RAs

*Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)* is a group of commonly prescribed drugs
used to suppress gastric acid production. They are prescribed for a
variety of indications, including the treatment of dyspepsia, peptic
ulcers and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, the eradication of H.
pylori and prophylaxis to prevent drug-induced gastrointestinal damage
(eg, from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).

A number of observational studies have found suggestions of increased
risks of a range of outcomes including pneumonia, chronic kidney
disease, cancer and alcoholic liver disease, as well as all cause
mortality, among those prescribed PPIs.

Various types of PPI exist: omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole,
rabeprazole or esomeprazole.

*H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs)* are a group of a gastric-acid
suppressing medications which are used for similar indications to PPIs.

H2RAs were available a number of years before PPIs. However, more
recently PPIs have become the most commonly prescribed acid-suppression
therapy in the UK. Superior efficacy of PPIs has been demonstrated in
trials for many indications.

Various types of H2RA exist: cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine,
nizatidine.

## R

The subsections below make brief comments about how we will use R in
these practical sessions.

### R markdown

To work through this R markdown (.Rmd) file, open RStudio, or
equivalent, and open the .Rmd file from within that. The file is a mix
of text and R code. Each short block of R code is called a "chunk".
There are various ways of running the R code. If you locate the "Run"
button on the ribbon and click on the down arrow to the right, this will
provide various ways of running the R chunks. Alternatively, if you
scroll down to a particular chunk, the green buttons to the right of the
screen offer to run the current chunk or to run all chunks above. If
your cursor is in a code chuck, you can also use the Ctrl+Shift+Enter
keyboard shortcut (Cmd+Shift+Enter on Mac) to run that chunk.

### Tidyverse

In these practicals, we will be using the tidyverse suite of tools, in
particular the `dplyr` package; if you aren't familiar with these, check
out the (very) brief introduction provided on Moodle.

Before you load this package, you will need to install it if you have
not already done so. This is achieved using the
`install.packages("tidyverse")` command. To input this command, find the
Console window in RStudio (the bottom window). Click to the right of the
blue greater-than sign to activate the window. Type the command
(install.packages("tidyverse")) into the Console and press Enter. You
only need to install the package once. After that, each time you want to
use the `tidyverse` package, you need to load it, as follows:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Read in data

### Read the Flat files

First we will read in all the raw data files (sometimes these are called
"flat files"). Make sure you have all the data in a folder called Sample
and all the codes in a folder called Codelists in the same folder as
this .Rmd notebook.

We could read in a single dataset, for example "Sample/Patient.csv", as
follows:

```{r, message=FALSE}
one_dataset <- read_csv("../Sample/Sim_Patient_sample.csv")
# view(one_dataset)
```

To look at this dataset, type in `View(one_dataset)` into the Console
and press Enter. This will bring up a new window showing you the dataset
called `one_dataset`.

To read in each data file individually would be very time consuming
since there are quite a few files. Therefore, to make our code more
efficient we can read them all at the same time. Further, we will store
all data files in one big list (called `data`) to keep things organised.
We can also directly grab the file names from the file paths and name
our list objects accordingly.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Make a list of all file paths and file names
files <- list.files("../Sample", full.names = TRUE, pattern = ".csv")
filenames <- str_to_lower(str_remove(str_remove(tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(files)), "_sample"), "Sim_"))

# Apply the read_csv function to all files and save the output as one big list
data <- lapply(files, readr::read_csv)
names(data) <- filenames
```

If you are struggling to see what the chunk of code above does, try
typing `files` into the Console window and press Enter. This will allow
you to see what the first line of code has stored within `files`.
Similarly, try typing `filenames`. The data are now stored within a big
list, `data`, which you can verify by typing `class(data)`. If you type
`data` into the Console, you will see that this list comprises 7
different `tibbles`, which is a posh type of data frame (i.e. R's
terminology for a dataset). These tibbles can be viewed individually,
for example by typing in: `View(data$patient)`.

### Factor variables

The following line of code lists the different items (the separate
datasets) in the `data` list and prints out each variable in the dataset
along with its format (i.e. is it a numerical variable, a logical
(true/false) variable, a string/character variable? And so on).

```{r}
sapply(data, function(x) sapply(x, class))
```

From the output above, we can see that, for example, the variable
`gender` in patient dataset is currently stored as a character variable.
In other words, the values are stored as the words "Female" and "Male".
To use the variable in analysis, it is more convenient to store this as
a factor, which is a number with labels under the hood (e.g. values 1
and 2, where 1 represents "Female" and 2 represents "Male"). We will now
convert all the categorical variables to factors rather than text
variables.

The first line of code below creates a list (called `factor_vars`) of
all the variables we want to covert to factors (i.e. categorical
variables) in the different datasets. The subsequent line of code
changes each of these from a character, or string, variable to a factor
variable.

```{r, results=FALSE}
# Specify which columns should be factors
factor_vars <- c("gender", "eth5", "constype", "imd_person")
# For all datasets, across any of the above specified columns, convert to factors
data <- map(data, ~.x %>% mutate(across(any_of(factor_vars), as_factor)))


```

By default, the levels of a factor are determined using the order of
appearance in the data, however this might not always be appropriate. Of
the variables we just converted to factors, there is one where we need
to make sure they levels are ordered: `imd_person`.

Check the levels of a factor using `levels()`. If it looks like they are
out of order, you will need to change the order of the levels. Given a
factor called my_factor with Levels: "second", "first", "third", we can
reorder the levels like this:
`my_factor <- factor(my_factor, levels = c("first", "second", "third"))`

```{r, results=FALSE}
levels(data$imd$imd_person)
data$imd$imd_person <- factor(data$imd$imd_person, levels = c("Least Deprived (1)", "2", "3", "4", "Most Deprived (5)"))
levels(data$imd$imd_person)
```

### Read the codelists

As well as the data files, you have been provided with a number of
codelists. We will explore the meaning and purpose of these in a later
session. For now, we will simply run the code to read these codelists
into R.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Make a list of all file paths and file names
files <- list.files("../Codelists", full.names = TRUE, pattern = "codes.csv")
filenames <- str_to_lower(str_remove(tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(files)), "_codes"))

# Apply the read_csv function to all files and save the output as one big list
codes <- lapply(files, readr::read_csv)
names(codes) <- filenames
```

The code above creates a list called `codes`, which contains many
different tibbles, or datasets, each containing a single codelist. If
you type `length(codes)` into the Console, you will see there are 33
codelists. To view an individual codelist, you can (for example) type
`View(codes$stroke)`.

## Create account in Open Codelists

In the second practical we will explore the steps used to create a new
codelist. In order to do this, you will need an account. Please do this
before the practical sessions.

1.  Go to <https://www.opencodelists.org/>
2.  Click "Sign up" and make an account

End of preparatory work

You are now ready to start the practical sessions below!

If you are less familiar with R, feel free to read ahead and try out
some of the code snippets prior to the scheduled sessions.

# Practical One: Exploring the data

This practical is split into two components. The first is not
computer-based and asks you to consider the feasibility of a study to
address a given research question. The second half of the practical
focuses on exploring the data at hand.

## Study design

We will now consider our research question for these practical sessions:
whether proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) increase subsequent all-cause
mortality.

Discussion questions

Thinking about the issues raised in the lecture, consider the following
questions:

-   What type of question is the research question?
-   Do you think this research question can be addressed using
    electronic health record data?
-   What are the big biases you might expect?
-   What is a sensible comparison group?
-   What variables would you ideally like to include in your analysis?
    What would their role be in that analysis? And do you think these
    variables are likely to be well recorded in these data?
-   How does calendar time affect your analysis? Have there been
    important changes you need to think about?

## Exploring the (artificial) data

The data consist of 7 datasets. We will begin by exploring the Patient
dataset. This contains details of the patients whose data are included
in the "flat files".

### The Patient file

You may want to start by using the command `View(data$patient)` to look
at the dataset.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
view(data$patient)
```

The code below asks how many rows of data there are in the Patient
dataset, and then how many unique patient IDs there are (variable:
`patid`). Note that the pipe (`%>%`) can be thought of as meaning "and
then". This code performs the following steps in sequence:

-   Open the dataset `data$patient`
-   Summarise the dataset by
    -   counting the number of rows, and
    -   counting the number of distinct values of `patid`

The result of performing those steps is printed out.

```{r}
total <- data$patient %>% n_distinct()

```

The dataset contains information about sex and ethnicity. Let's tabulate
sex. To do this, we will again use the pipe to perform a number of
actions in sequence. We will:

-   Open the dataset `data$patient`
-   Divide the data by sex (into Males and Females)
-   Summarise each of the sub-datasets by counting the number of rows
    (i.e. counting the numbers of males and females)
-   Calculate the overall percentages (of males and females within the
    sample) from those counts

```{r}
Male <- data$patient %>%  filter(gender == "Male")
Female <- data$patient %>%  filter(!(gender == "Male"))

n_male <- Male$patid %>% n_distinct()
n_female <- Female$patid %>% n_distinct()

m_percent <- n_male/total
f_percent <- n_female/total
```

The variable `crd` contains the date at which the patient registered at
the general practice (within which these data were collected). The
variable `tod` contains the date at which the patient transferred out of
that practice. This latter variable is empty if the patient was still
registered at that practice at the end date of data extraction (17 April
2017).

Use the following code to graph the date at which patients registered at
their general practice.

```{r}

ggplot(data = data$patient) +
  geom_histogram(aes(crd), bins = 50)
```

### The Consultation file

The Consultation file contains data about all consultations recorded for
the patients in the data extract.

```{r}
head(data$consultations)
```

The following histogram shows how many consultations different patients
have recorded. Remember that the length of time a person is followed-up
in these data might vary a lot.

```{r}
numbers_consult <- data$consultations %>%
  group_by(patid) %>%
  summarize(nconsult = n()) 

hist(numbers_consult$nconsult)
```

We can explore the period of time over which consultations took place,
using the following code:

```{r}
hist(data$consultations$eventdate, "years")

```

Question

What possible explanations might there be for the sudden jump that you
can see in the graph above?

### Explore links between patient and consultation file

The command `anti_join` returns a dataset containing the rows of the
first dataset (here `patient`) for any row that is not matched to the
second dataset (`consultations`) by the matching variable provided
(`patid`).

The code below shows us there are no patients without any consultations.

```{r}
nrow(anti_join(data$patient, data$consultations, by = "patid"))

```

Similarly, there are no consultations without a patient.

```{r}
nrow(anti_join(data$consultations, data$patient, by = "patid"))
```

### Explore links between consultation and clinical file

The number of rows and patients in the Clinical file are shown below:

```{r}
data$clinical %>%
  summarize(nrow=n(), 
  npatient=n_distinct(patid))
```

The Consultations and Clinical data are linked by the identifier
`consid`.

Question

Are there any clinical data not linked to a consultation? Conversely,
are there any consultations with no associated clinical data?

```{r}
nrow(anti_join(data$consultations, data$clinical, by = "consid"))
nrow(anti_join(data$clinical, data$consultations, by = "consid"))


```

### Exploring the additional data (BMI, weight and height)

The clinical file has no obvious place (variable) to store continuous
measurements. So, for example, if the general practitioner measures a
patient's weight, this is a clinical measurement and - as such - should
be recorded in the clinical file. Similarly, there is no convenient way
of recording a patient's alcohol consumption or details of their smoking
status in the clinical file. Additional information such as this is
stored in the Additional file. It is linked to the corresponding entry
in the Clinical file via the additional data identifier (`adid`). The
clinical file has a variable representing the entity type (variable
`enttype`) which identifies the type of Clinical information stored in
that row of data.

To obtain all the weight measurements, we have to identify the type of
entity which represents weight. This can be found in a text file that
you have been provided with (Lists.txt). That file informs us that
weight and body mass index (BMI) both fall under the entity type 13.
This is stored in the variable `enttype` in the Clinical file. Further,
this spreadsheet informs us that if it is a weight measurement, this
will be stored in kilograms as `data1` (in the Additional file) but if
it is a BMI measurement, it will be stored as `data3`.

You might wonder why the additional data file contains no date variable
to tell us the date on which a particular measurement, or recording, was
made. This is because each entry in the additional data file corresponds
to an entry in the Clinical data file; the latter (the Clinical data
file) contains the relevant date.

In order to look at the recorded weight measurements, we need to:

1.  Open the Clinical file
2.  Extract all entries with entity type indicating a weight measurement
    (`enttype`=13)
3.  Merge these entries to the corresponding additional data in the
    Additional file, linked by the identifier `adid`
4.  Keep those with a non-missing entry in the variable `data1` (weight,
    in kilograms)

The code chunk below performs those steps in sequence. Just to keep
things simple, the last line keeps only the variables for the patient
identifier, the weight measurement and the date of the measurement.

The subsequent command graphs the weight measurements. Does the
distribution look reasonable?

```{r}

```

We will use similar code to extract BMI data (entity type 13, with data
stored in variable data3 in the Additional file).

```{r}

```

And similarly, height:

```{r}

```

Question

What do you think about the distributions of height, weight and BMI? Are
they sensible? If not, what are likely explanations for what you see?
Think about how any errors or measurement error might arise.

We might be happy to make clinical judgements about what an implausible
value is, and to remove those values. For example, we might think that
heights of more than 2.15 metres are implausible. The next chunk of code
removes "implausible" values for all three variables and graphs the
remaining values:

```{r}

```

Question

What do you think about the assumptions made and the resulting
distributions?

We will return to the BMI data in practical 4.

## Summary

In this practical session we have explored a number of different aspects
of the (artificial) data that we will be using through the module. The
key messages that we hope you will take from this are:

-   It is really important to understand the collection process to
    understand the limitations and quirks of the data.
-   Assumptions are unavoidable when wrangling these data for analysis.
    These assumptions will have consequences for the analysis so these
    need to be carefully thought out, documented and communicated.

# Practical Two: Using codelists

This practical is in two parts. In the first, we will use the Open
Codelists tool to create some codelists, so you can get a feel for how
the process works. Don't worry if you do not have the required clinical
expertise to do a good job - we will not be using your codelists!

In the second part of the practical, we will use codelists to begin to
extract a cohort to address our research question relating to PPIs and
mortality.

## Create codelists using the opencodelists builder

The Open Codelist tool provides a simple to use codelist builder.

1.  Sign into your previously-created account at
    <https://www.opencodelists.org/>
2.  Click "My codelists" and then "Create a codelist"

### Read codes for stomach cancer

Create a codelist called "stomach cancer" using CTV3(Read V3) as the
coding system. The codelist should contain diagnosis codes for malignant
stomach cancer (synonyms: gastric cancer, neoplasm of stomach) including
all types of malignant cancer (e.g. carcinomas, lymphomas,
adenocarcinomas), but not include benign tumours. Only include codes for
clinical findings, and not for other categories such as procedures,
assessment scales, etc. and don't include codes for family history of
stomach cancer. Once you are done, click save for review and have a look
at the "Full list" and the "Tree" tabs.

### SNOMED codes for proton pump inhibitors

Create a codelist called "PPI" using SNOMED as the coding system. The
codelist should contain product codes for proton pump inhibitors.
Include only codes in the product category. Once you are done, click
save for review and have a look at the "Full list" and the "Tree" tabs.

### ICD codes for diabetes

Create a codelist called "diabetes" using ICD-10 as the coding system.
The codelist should contain diagnosis codes for diabetes mellitus,
including type 1, type 2 and pregnancy related (Hint: Diabetes insipidus
is unrelated to diabetes mellitus). Don't include "history of" or
"family history of" codes, or other diseases related to diabetes. Once
you are done, click save for review and have a look at the "Full list"
and the "Tree" tabs.

Discussion questions

Have a go at creating the three codelists above in the three different
coding systems.

-   *Read codes for stomach cancer* Did you have to search for multiple
    synonyms to find all the relevant codes?
-   *SNOMED codes for proton pump inhibitors* How many "child" codes are
    (typically) associated with one "parent"?
-   *ICD codes for diabetes* Remembering what each coding system
    contains and how they are organised, do you think creating this
    particular codelist would have been more difficult or less difficult
    using Read codes or SNOMED, and why?
-   What differences did you find between creating the three codelists?
    Were some easier than others? Why?

## The research question: PPIs and mortality

To address our research question of whether proton pump inhibitors
(PPIs) increase all cause mortality, we will compare people who receive
a PPI with those who receive a different drug, a H2RA, in terms of their
subsequent mortality. Although the two classes of drugs are prescribed
for similar indications (reasons), these two groups of patients are
likely to be different in various ways, so we will need to account for
confounding. To increase our confidence that we have adequately captured
information about confounding, we will insist that our patients in this
comparison have been registered at their general practice for at least a
year prior to their prescription (to allow time for the general practice
to gather information about the patient's prior health).

Finally, we will only consider patients whose first PPI or H2RA
prescription is given during the period from 1 January 1991 and 17 April
2017.

Identifying this eligible patient group and exploring their prior health
status will require us to use codelists. In the remainder of the current
practical, we will use drug codelists for PPIs and H2RAs to identify the
eligible patient group. We will then use codelists for some key
comorbidities to extract information about the patients' health status
prior to receiving their first PPI or H2RA prescription.

## Identifying the eligible patient population

Have a look at the Therapy dataset.

```{r}
head(data$therapy)
```

We will need the `ppi` and `h2ra` codelists to identify prescriptions
for PPIs and H2RAs, respectively. These codelists map to the therapy
dataset using the identifier `prodcode`. The codelists additionally
contain a variable indicating the name of the product (`prodname`) and
the relevant drug substance (`substance`). For PPIs and H2RAs, the
codelists contain an additional column (`drug`), which divides PPIs and
H2RAs into clinically useful sub-groups.

```{r}
head(codes$ppi)
head(codes$h2ra)
```

In order to identify the group described above, the first step is to
identify each patient's date of first PPI or H2RA prescription. To do
this, we need to perform the following steps:

-   Identify rows of the Therapy dataset (i.e. prescriptions) that match
    the PPI codelist (i.e. prescriptions for PPI).
-   Identify rows of the Therapy dataset (i.e. prescriptions) that match
    the H2RA codelist (i.e. prescriptions for H2RA).
-   Put these lists of prescriptions together
-   Finally, we retain the first (earliest date) per person.

The code below performs the first three steps to obtain a list of all
prescriptions for PPI and H2RA in our data. This is stored in an object
called `ppis_h2ras`.

```{r}
ppi <- data$therapy %>%  inner_join(codes$ppi, by = "prodcode") %>% mutate(ppi = 1)
h2rd <- data$therapy %>%  inner_join(codes$h2ra, by = "prodcode") %>% mutate(ppi = 0)

ppis_2hras <- rbind(ppi, h2rd)
```

We only want the first such prescription. We want to keep the patient
identifier, the date of the first prescription and whether the
prescription was for a PPI or a H2RA.

Note that to keep the first prescription, we have to sort by patient and
then, within patient, by the event (prescription) date. Then the
`filter` line keeps the top row of data (which is the one with the
lowest numerical date, which is equivalent to the chronologically
earliest date). The code below does this then prints the number of rows
in the `cohort` dataset.

```{r}
cohort <- ppis_2hras %>% arrange(patid, eventdate) %>% group_by(patid) %>% slice(1)

```

We will now implement the exclusion criteria listed previously. First,
we will remove patients for whom their first PPI/H2RA prescription was
less than one year after registration. The registration date can be
found in the "Patient" file and is stored in a variable called `crd`.
Again, print the number of rows (the number of patients).

```{r}
cohort <- cohort %>% # Take the cohort dataset created in the previous step ...
  left_join(data$patient[c("patid", "crd")], by="patid") %>% #...and join the "Patient" dataset ...
  filter(eventdate > crd+365.25)
  
cohort <- cohort %>% filter(eventdate >= as.Date("1991-01-01") & eventdate <= as.Date("2017-04-17"))
nrow(cohort)
```

Finally, we will remove patients for whom the first PPI/H2RA
prescription was before 1 January 1991 or after 17 April 2017. Print the
number of rows.

```{r}

```

The remaining patients are eligible. The date of their first PPI/H2RA
prescription is the date that the patient enters our study. We will call
this their *index date*. The code below renames the patients' date of
first prescription from `eventdate` to `indexdate` to reflect this. The
purpose of the `cohort` dataset is to tell us who is in our eligible
patient cohort so we can remove any additional information. Therefore,
the code below drops all variables except for `patid` (patient
identifier), `indexdate` (date of entering study) and `ppi` (exposure
group).

```{r}
cohort <- cohort %>% 
  select(patid, eventdate, ppi) %>% 
  rename(indexdate = eventdate)
cohort
```

**OPTIONAL**

A flowchart is a common way of clearly communicating this process. In
randomized clinical trials, the CONSORT diagram is a required element of
a report of the trial. Similar flowcharts are often used in
observational study to quickly show which patients were included and
excluded.

The `consort` package in R can create such flowcharts. First, you will
need to install the package (`install.packages("consort")`). Then the
following code illustrates a simple use of this package:

```{r}

```

Question

Think about different ways of drawing a flowchart here. Does the order
matter? What are the key criteria for a good flowchart?

**End Optional section**

## Identify data on comorbidities

We have a list of eligible patients and the date at which each patient
became eligible. We know whether the patients received a PPI or a H2RA
prescription. We now want to consider the health status of these two
groups at that point in time (at the index date).

We will consider two different settings:

1.  Ever diagnosed with X (prior to the index date)
2.  Recently experienced X (in relation to the index date)

In both cases, information on X will be extracted by taking the rows of
the Clinical file that appear in a relevant codelist. We will also need
to use our `cohort` dataset to restrict attention to those patients who
are eligible for our study and to know when their index date is.

Before continuing with the programming below, think about the steps
required to obtain a list of eligible patients who fit criteria 1 and 2
above. What order do you think we need to merge/join datasets? Try to
write down the required steps before proceeding below.

For example, to obtain a list of eligible patients who meet criterion 1.
we could:

(A) Open the Clinical file. Join to the cohort data, keeping rows of the
    Clinical file that belong to patients in the cohort dataset. Drop
    events in the Clinical file that occur after (or on) the index date.
    Join to the codelist for X, keeping only rows of the Clinical file
    that match the codelist file. Keep one row per patient. Generate an
    indicator of prior diagnosis of X. Keep patient IDs and indicator.

or

(B) Open the Clinical file. Join to the codelist for X, keeping only
    rows of the Clinical file which match codes in the codelist. Keep
    the first relevant code for each patient. Join to the cohort
    dataset, keeping patient IDs that match the Clinical/codelist data.
    Drop events that occur after (or on) the index date. Generate an
    indicator of prior diagnosis of X. Keep patient IDs and indicator.

Question

Which approach is better? And why? Would they both lead you to the
correct list?

Now suppose you are only interested in diagnoses that occurred within
the year prior to the index date. How would you adapt the strategies
above? Which would work better?

### Diabetes

Now we have our list of eligible patients and the date at which they
became eligible. We will now extract some data on comorbidities for
these people. One likely confounder of the relationship between PPIs and
mortality is whether or not the patient had been diagnosed with
diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic condition, therefore we are interested
in whether the patient has *ever* been diagnosed with diabetes prior to
entering our study (i.e. prior to their index date).

Within our data, information on diagnoses is stored within the Clinical
file. We have a diabetes codelist. Have a look at the codelist using the
code: `View(codes$diabetes)`. The codelists link to the Clinical file
via the identifier `medcode`.

To obtain a list of patients who have been diagnosed with diabetes, we
want to follow these steps:

-   Retain rows of the Clinical dataset with codes that appear in the
    diabetes codelist.
-   Keep the first event per patient.

```{r}

```

At this stage, our object `diabetes` contains a list of the first
diagnosis for the whole set of patients represented in the data (for
those patients who have experienced a diabetes diagnosis).

But not all these are eligible for our study. So we now want to restrict
this to patients who appear in our eligible patient group. To do this,
we join the `diabetes` list to the previously created `cohort` (list of
eligible patients), keeping only rows with matches.

```{r}

```

Some of these diagnoses may be after the patient becomes eligible, in
which case we do not want to count that diagnosis, so we now remove
diagnoses which occurred after the index date.

```{r}

```

At this stage, we have a dataset containing a list of patients who have
experienced the diagnosis of interest prior to becoming eligible (prior
to their index date). It is often helpful to have an indicator of binary
variables like this (i.e. 0=Absent, 1=Present), so the code below
creates this. Finally, we keep only the variables required for
subsequent analysis (namely, patient identifier and the indicator that
the patient had diabetes).

```{r}

```

We have gone through the steps one by one above to see what the code was
doing. However, the beauty of this R package is that these steps can be
done in one block of code. In this case, we could have obtained our
diabetes indicator in the single step below:

```{r}

```

*Hint*: If you get confused about these big blocks of code you can
truncate to the first x number of actions (e.g. you could remove all
code after "`eventdate)`" on the third line above and run that to see
where the code takes you at that point. Then you can add in the lines
after one by one to step through the code. You can also select the part
of the code you want to run (e.g. from `data$clinical` up to
`arrange(patid, eventdate))` and hit Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on Mac) to
run only the selected code.

### Recent GERD (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease)

Note that the abbreviation GERD comes from the US spelling of the
condition. The abbreviation GORD, following the British spelling, is
less frequently used.

Sometimes we are only interested in recent events. For example, a
transient condition that has been cured long in the past is probably not
going to be a relevant confounder.

This is different from above because we are only interested in events
near to the index date, so we can't just drop all but the first records
per patient. Therefore, we will perform the following steps:

1.  Join `cohort` to the clinical data, keeping only rows with matches.
2.  Arrange (sort) by patient ID and eventdate
3.  Keep only rows with a medcode that appears in the GERD codelist
4.  Keep only entries for clinical events within 6 months (180 days) of
    the index date
5.  Keep only the first event per patient.
6.  Create an indicator called `recent_gerd` set to 1
7.  Drop all but the indicator and patient IDs and name the resulting
    object `recent_gerd` (same as the indicator variable).

Look through the code below and make sure you understand how the steps
map to the code.

```{r}

```

## Summary

In this practical session we have used codelists to extract an eligible
patient population based on a drug prescription, used a codelist to
identify a past diagnosis and recent clinical events. The key messages
that we hope you will take from this are:

-   Codelists are a vital step in process of going from raw data to
    variables that can be used in analysis.
-   The assumptions made in creating the codelists can have important
    impact on the analysis but these assumptions are not always
    explicit.

# Practical Three: Drug exposure data

In this practical we will explore the drug exposure data.

> **Please note** the drug data, in particular, are not very
> sophisticated. We will explore various facets of these data for the
> purposes of demonstration but please remember that these are
> artificial. The real patterns of prescriptions are likely to look a
> bit different.

## Quantity and daily dose

In this practical we will focus on the drugs that define our exposure of
interest: PPIs and H2RAs. For comparison, we will also look at oral
anticoagulants. We begin by extracting all prescriptions in our data for
these three drugs.

```{r}

```

### Quantity

The data contain a variable, `qty`, which tells us the quantity that was
prescribed. Below we graph this variable for the three drugs.

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

Question

What are the most commonly prescribed quantities for each drug?

### Daily dose

The daily dose variable is estimated by the (imaginary) database. Each
prescription comes with text instructions for the patient (e.g. "take
three times daily"). Where possible, the daily dose is extracted from
these instructions. For the example just provided, the daily dose would
be 3.

The code below tabulates the daily doses for the three drugs in turn.

```{r}

```

Question

What do you think the zero dose means? Are there different proportions
of zero doses for the three drugs? Why might that be?

### Duration

We can use the quantity provided and the estimated daily dose to obtain
the duration, using the formula: duration = quantity/daily dose. The
code below does this, setting the duration to missing if the daily dose
is given as zero.

```{r}

```

The graphs below show the durations.

```{r}

```

Question

Do the duration plots show different patterns to the quantity plots?

### Strength

We also have data on the substance strength. The code below tabulates
these data for the three drugs.

```{r}

```

Question

Why do you think there are some entries given in the form of a sum?

## Treatment persistence

In our study, the main exposure is a drug exposure. We are therefore
very interested in the pattern of prescriptions for that exposure over
time. Do the patients in the PPI group continue to receive PPI
prescriptions indefinitely, or do many discontinue PPIs soon after
entering the study? We will now begin to explore this issue.

### Subsequent prescriptions for PPI in the PPI group

The code below picks out a list of patients who entered our study in the
PPI group and stores them in an object called `ppi_group`. Similarly,
`h2ra_group` is a list of patients who entered our study in the H2RA
group.

```{r}

```

The following code picks out all PPI prescriptions given to patients in
the ppi_group on or after study entry and counts the number per patient.

```{r}

```

Question

How may patients in the PPI group in our study had no further
prescriptions for PPI? Is this a problem?

> Note: The apparent jump in frequency at 20 prescriptions is an
> artefact of the artificial generation process. The number was capped
> at 20 to restrict the size of the simulated therapy file. This would
> obviously not be a feature in real data!

The code below repeats the analysis above for the H2RA group and
explores the number of subsequent H2RA prescriptions. First, we obtain a
list of patients in the H2RA exposure group.

```{r}

```

Then we pick out subsequent H2RA prescriptions for these individuals,
following their index date (study entry).

```{r}

```

We tabulate and plot the number of H2RA prescriptions for the H2RA group
below.

```{r}

```

### Treatment switching

In our study, our main comparison is between patients prescribed one
drug (PPIs) and another (H2RAs). We are therefore particularly
interested in patients who switch from one drug to the other. We call
this treatment switching.

In this section we will explore whether many of the patients in the PPI
group subsequently receive a prescription for H2RA. Conversely, we will
see how many of the H2RA group subsequently receive a prescription for
PPI.

The following code explores what proportion of the PPI group
subsequently had a prescription for a H2RA during the study follow-up.

```{r}

```

Similarly, we can explore the proportion of the H2RA group who had a
subsequent prescription for a PPI during study follow-up.

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

### (Optional) Treatment patterns over time

This sub-section is completely optional and is here for interest only.
In particular, you do not need to explore treatment patterns for the
assessment.

Below, we explore the patterns of PPI prescription experienced during
the study period (i.e. from a patient's index date to the end of the
study).

The code below extracts a list of all patients who had at least one
prescription for a PPI on or after their index date. It keeps only a
list of patient IDs in the object `anyppi`. This is the group of
patients for whom we are interested in looking at PPI treatment
patterns.

```{r}

```

We are going to use some survival analysis tools to manipulate the data,
so we now install the required package. You may need to install the
package first (`install.packages("survival")`).

```{r}

```

We now restrict our cohort to those who have had at least one PPI
prescription on or after their index date. We will look for
prescriptions between that date and 17 April 2017 (the overall study
end-date). We add 0.5 days to this last date (`endstudydate` below) for
people who only entered the study on 17 April 2017, so R can distinguish
between the two events (survival analysis tools often require the end
date to be strictly after the start date).

```{r}

```

The code below tells R when individual patients enter and exit the study
(at `indexdate` and `endstudydate`, respectively). Don't worry too much
about the syntax here - we are merely using this code to get the data in
the format we want.

```{r}

```

We now take all PPI prescriptions that occurred on or after the index
date. We calculate the duration of the prescription, from the quantity
and daily dose. We will assume the prescription covers the period of
time from the prescription date for a period of `duration` days. Below,
the variables `start` and `stop` represent the date of getting a PPI
prescription and the assumed end date of that prescription,
respectively.

```{r}

```

At this point, the object `ppi` contains multiple rows per patient, each
indicating the start and stop time of being on a PPI prescription. We
now need to augment this data by adding rows for the times in between,
i.e. the periods of not being on a PPI prescription.

Again, don't worry too much about the details of the code. As long as
you understand the format of the data we're aiming for that's all that
is needed for our purposes today.

```{r}

```

We're now going to put these two datasets together. To do that, we will
first order the variables in the same order in each dataset.

```{r}

```

Now we will put the two datasets together:

```{r}

```

Now we add the time-updating PPI prescriptions (and non-prescriptions)
to the cohort data.

```{r}

```

Finally, we will select a small number of individuals and plot their PPI
prescription patterns over time. For visual simplicity, the code below
selects 10 patients who entered the study at about the same time (\~July
2015).

```{r}

```

Question

Describe the patterns you can see. How realistic do you suppose these
patterns are? (Remember these are artificial data).

## Summary

In this practical session we have explored the detailed drug data
available in EHR records. The key messages that we hope you will take
from this are:

-   The date a patient is prescribed a particular drug is easy to
    extract. Obtaining information on the dose and duration is much more
    complex.
-   Quantity, dose and duration are key for interpreting the data, but
    these are not always reliably recorded.
-   Assumptions inevitably must be made to obtain drug exposure and
    duration variables.

# Practical Four: Extracting an analysis dataset

## PPI study design

Here is an overview of the study design we will implement.

*Study aim* To estimate the effect of proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
prescription, versus a H2RA prescription, on subsequent all cause
mortality.

*Eligibility criteria:* Patients whose records are held in our made-up
database, who:

-   have at least one prescription for either a PPI or a H2RA.

Further, the first such prescription must be: - after the date of the
patient's registration at the general practice plus one year - between 1
January 1991 and 17 April 2017

*Exposure* PPI prescription versus H2RA prescription

*Confounders* Age, sex, deprivation (measured by the Index of Multiple
Deprivation, IMD), calendar year, prior diagnosis of diabetes, GERD in
the last 6 months.

*Follow-up* For each patient, follow-up begins at the first prescription
for PPI or H2RA. Ends at the first of: death, end of study (17 April
2017) and transfer out of the general practice.

*Outcome* All cause mortality

## Identify follow-up time and death data

In order to identify when a patient exits the study, we need to find the
date of their death (if it occurs) and transfer out of the general
practice (if that occurs). The exit date (`enddate`) is the first of
either of these or the overall study end, 17 April 2017.

So, to obtain the study exit date for each patient, we undertake the
following steps:

-   Open list of eligible people with their index date.
-   Merge to the Patient file
-   The end-date for an individual is the first of: date of death
    (`deathdate`), date of transfer out of the practice (`tod`), and the
    end of study date (17th April 2017).\
-   Save dataset with patient, death date and end-date.

```{r}

```

We will also add the date of switching to the alternate exposure group
in case we want to undertake sensitivity analyses using this
information.

```{r}

```

## Identify confounder data from Patient and Additional files

Age, sex, deprivation, calendar year and BMI are likely to be key
confounders of the relationship between PPI prescription and subsequent
all-cause mortality. The subsequent sections extract data on these
potential confounders.

### Demographic patient information

Information on age, sex, deprivation and calendar year of study entry
(index date) are held in the Patient file. To extract these variables,
we need to:

-   Merge the list of eligible patients with the Patient file.
-   Pick up year of birth, sex, IMD (index of multiple deprivation).
-   Create approximate age by assuming month=June, day=15th.(Generally,
    EHR databases release only non-granular dates of birth, e.g. year of
    birth, as here).
-   Extract calendar year from the index date. Group into: 1991-1999,
    2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2014, 2015-2017.
-   Save list of patient IDs and age, sex, IMD, calendar year.

```{r}

```

### BMI measurements

There are two ways of obtaining BMI measurements. Sometimes it is
entered into the EHR system directly, as a BMI measurement.
Alternatively the patient's weight might be measured. If a height
measurement is available, this can be converted into a BMI. The code
below allows either, but takes the version calculated from a weight
measurement where possible.

Make sure you can run the code below. *Don't worry too much about
understanding all the lines at this stage.*

The code below is similar to the code you used in the earlier practical
to explore the BMI data. In addition to what you did then, this code
restricts to measurements on patents in our eligible cohort and adds
requirements about how recent the measurements were. Heights are
required to be taken after the patient was 17 years old (under the
assumption that heights are relatively stable thereon). Weights and BMI
are required to be within 5 years of the index date (i.e. we want the
difference between the index date (study entry) and weight/BMI
measurement to be between 0 and 5\*365.25, with the index date coming
later than the measurement).

The first chunk of code extracts direct measurements of BMI (i.e. the GP
has calculated BMI themselves and entered this into the system as a BMI
measurement). Typically, we would prefer to take a weight measurement
and calculate BMI ourselves, to avoid errors in calculation. Therefore,
below we create a preference variable, which marks these direct BMI
measures as less preferred (variable `preference` is set to 2).

```{r}

```

The next chunk of code extracts weight measurements and combines them
with height measurements to calculate BMI. The preference variable is
set to 1, indicating these calculated values will be taken in preference
to direct entries of BMI.

```{r}

```

Finally, we combine the two sources of BMI information, taking our
calculated version if available and the directly entered version
otherwise. Note that we could take different approaches here - we might
prefer a direct entry if it is much more recent, for example.

```{r}

```

## Merge all files together

Finally, we will put all the different files together to obtain an
analysis dataset. Let's merge together:

-   the cohort and comorbidities created in Practical 2
-   the additional follow-up information (treatment switching) obtained
    in Practical 3
-   and the enddates, demographic patient information and BMI created in
    Practical 4

One we've merged these datasets there is a small amount of tidying to be
done. For example, patients who do not have a prior diagnosis of
diabetes will have their diabetes variable (`prior_diabetes`) set to NA
(missing) by the merge. The last line of code below therefore replaces
these NAs with 0, indicating the absence of the diagnosis.

```{r}

```

Finally, we will save the data in your working directory, for use in
subsequent practical sessions.

```{r}

```

## Summary

In this practical session we have assembled our final dataset. The key
messages that we hope you will take from this are:

-   Extracting an analysis dataset from Electronic Health Record data is
    a complex multi-step process, combining the use of codelists,
    phenotyping, drug exposure determination, application of algorithms,
    etc.
-   Many assumptions are required to go from the flat files to an
    analysis dataset. It is vital that these assumptions are documented
    and communicated along with the analysis results. Sensitivity
    analysis exploring sensitivity of results to these assumptions is an
    important part of any EHR analysis.

# Practical 5: Regression modelling

This first analysis practical focuses on regression modelling. We will
use the dataset that you extracted in the first four EHR practicals. We
initially use linear regression to explore the relationship between BMI,
age and sex. We then focus on exploring predictors of PPI prescription.

## Load packages and data

Load the needed packages first

```{r}

```

And read in the analysis dataset:

```{r}

```

## Body mass index, age and sex

Before performing any regression models, we will explore the relevant
data.

### Explore BMI, age and sex

Draw histograms of BMI and age:

```{r}

```

Create a scatterplot of BMI and age:

```{r}

```

Create a boxplot of BMI by sex:

```{r}

```

Summarise BMI by sex, using appropriate summary statistics.

```{r}

```

It is always a good idea to check for missing values. Obtain the overall
sample size and the number of missing values for age, gender and BMI:

```{r}

```

Question

Based on the descriptive statistics above, what relationship does BMI
have with age and sex?

### Linear regression model

First, we fit a linear regression model of BMI on age:

```{r}

```

We can look at the fitted model using the `summary` command:

```{r}

```

Alternatively, the `tidy` command of the `broom` package presents
results in a nicely formatted way. This is installed as part of the
tidyverse package.

```{r}

```

Question

Interpret each of the two regression coefficients in the model above.
Does there appear to be a relationship between BMI and age?

The `glance` function of the `broom` package provides overall model
statistics, including the R-squared and AIC.

```{r}

```

Question

Does the relationship between age and BMI explain much of the
variability in BMI?

**OPTIONAL** The `augment` function of the `broom` package adds columns
to the dataset containing information such as fitted values and
residuals.

```{r}

```

Look at the new dataframe and make sure you understand what the new
variables are. Create a histogram o the `.resid` variable:

```{r}

```

Plot the `.fitted` variable against the `.resid` variable:

```{r}

```

Question

Based on the graphs above, do you think the assumptions of the linear
model are satisfied?

Sometimes the assumptions of linearity, homoscedasticity and normality
of error term hold more closely on a transformed scale. For instance, we
could take each value of BMI and take the logarithm of the value. This
transformation tends to take right-skewed data (data with a few very
high values) and make it a little more symmetric. Fit a linear
regression model of log-BMI on age.

```{r}

```

Question

Do the assumptions seem to be better (or worse) satisfied after
transforming the outcome?

**End Optional section**

Explore the relationship between BMI and both age and sex:

```{r}

```

Add an interaction between age and sex:

```{r}

```

Question

Is there evidence of an interaction between age and sex in their
association with BMI?

**OPTIONAL SECTION**

To explore whether the relationship between BMI and age is non-linear,
add a squared and cubic term

```{r}

```

Fit a model with just a constant term. Use the `anova` function to
compare the age model above with the empty model.

```{r}

```

Question

Interpret the p-value from the F test.

**End Optional section**

## Determinants of PPI prescription (versus H2RA)

Our dataset contains patients who were prescribed either a proton pump
inhibitor (PPI) or a H2RA. We are going to explore predictors of PPI
prescription (as opposed to H2RA prescription). First, we will tabulate
the exposure:

```{r}

```

Question

Is PPI prescription a rare event in this data? Are we likely to have
problems with model fitting?

### Date of first PPI/H2RA prescription

Draw a histogram of the date of prescription of the first PPI or H2RA:

```{r}

```

Now split the histogram by exposure group (i.e. PPI or H2RA).

```{r}

```

Create a table showing the proportion of prescriptions in the data which
are for PPI, rather than H2RA, over time.

```{r}

```

Question

Based on the graphs and table above, how would you describe the change
in prescription pattern over time?

### Predictors of treatment (PPI vs H2RA)

Our "outcome" of interest is PPI prescription (versus H2RA
prescription). As this is a binary characteristic (patients had only two
options - a PPI prescription or a H2RA prescription), logistic
regression is a sensible choice of GLM to use to model these data.

We will now use logistic regression models to explore predictors of
treatment with PPI versus H2RA. The model below includes a single
continuous predictor, age at prescription (index date) measured in
years.

```{r}

```

Question

Interpret the odds ratio for age and its 95% confidence interval. What
is the estimate on the (Intercept) line?

What is the null hypothesis associated with the rather small p-value
above for age? Interpret the p-value.

The code below explores a single binary predictor.

```{r}

```

Question

What is the odds of being prescribed a PPI (rather than a H2RA) for
patients with no prior diabetes? What is the odds for those who do have
a history of diabetes?

**OPTIONAL**

Back-transform the odds of being prescribed a PPI among those with and
without prior diabetes to obtain the predicted risk (or probability) of
being prescribed a PPI in those two groups.

Question

What is the mathematical relationship between the probability and the
odds?

```{r}

```

**End Optional section**

The code below explores a single categorical predictor (calendar
period).

Suppose we want to fit a logistic regression model for binary Y with a
single categorical variable, C, with C= 0, 1, 2. Our general model is:

$$
log(\pi_x/(1−\pi_x))= \beta_0 + \bf{x}^T \boldsymbol\beta
$$

Suppose we set C=0 to be the reference, or baseline, category for
variable C. We create "dummy" variables (indicators for each
non-reference category of C). For instance:

-   C1 is a variable which takes value 1 if C=1 and 0 otherwise
-   C2 is a variable which takes value 1 if C=2 and 0 otherwise

Then we fit the model

$$
log(\pi_x/(1−\pi_x))= \beta_0 + \beta_1 C1+\beta_2 C2
$$

-   The parameter $\beta_1$ is the log of the odds ratio comparing C=1
    with C=0.
-   The parameter $\beta_2$ is the log of the odds ratio comparing C=2
    with C=0.

Fit a logistic regression model relating PPI prescription to the
calendar period.

```{r}

```

Question

How should we interpret the rather large estimate (around 25)?

Why should we not interpret the individual p-values in this model?

**OPTIONAL**

Use the likelihood ratio test to obtain a p-value testing the hypothesis
that calendar period is not associated with the probability of receiving
a PPI prescription. You may have to first install the `lmtest` package
(using the command `install.packages("lmtest"))`.

```{r}

```

Question

How should we interpret the p-value from this test? What null hypothesis
is it testing?

**End Optional section**

Finally, we will include all the potential predictors in the same model:

```{r}

```

Question

How should we interpret the estimate labelled "genderMale"?

We can use this model to predict the probability of receiving a
prescription for PPI (rather than for H2RA):

```{r}

```

Draw a histogram of the predicted probabilities:

```{r}

```

Question

What do you think accounts for the strange bumps we are seeing here?

## Summary

In this practical session we have explored a number of different
regression models using the data we assembled from the (artificial) data
in the first four practical sessions. The key messages that we hope you
will take from this are:

-   Regression modelling is a powerful and flexible tool for exploring
    relationships between an outcome and a set of explanatory/predictor
    variables
-   Initial exploratory analysis is really important to be able to
    understand the regression output

# Practical 6: Causal inference

This R Markdown file contains the causal inference practical using the
artificial electronic health record data. We will use the dataset that
you extracted in the first four EHR practicals and focus on estimating
the effect of PPI prescription (compared with H2RA prescription) on the
risk of 5-year mortality.

Note that for simplicity we will also remove anyone with any missing BMI
data from our analysis dataset. In real life we would use a range of
techniques to handle the missing BMI data; for today's session, however,
we wish to focus our attention on the estimation of causal effects.

## Load packages and data

Load the needed packages first

```{r}

```

And read in the analysis dataset, removing any patient with missing BMI
data:

```{r}

```

In this practical, we will begin to explore the relationship between the
outcome - all cause mortality - and the exposure - PPI prescription. We
will initially ignore the time-to-event aspect of the outcome variable,
while we are still learning survival analysis. We will bring these two
elements together later!

For now, our outcome will be the binary variable of death within 5
years. Patients who had their first prescription for PPI or H2RA less
than 5 years prior to the study end (12th April 2017) did not have the
opportunity of being followed-up for 5 years. Note that even for the
remaining patients, some will have been followed up for a shorter time
than others (some patients will have transferred out of their general
practice before the 5 years ended). In real life, we would use some sort
of survival analysis to explore this outcome in these data.

We will estimate the average causal effect of PPI prescription (vs H2RA
prescription) on 5-year all-cause mortality, as quantified by the risk
ratio and risk difference.

Throughout the practical, we will talk about exposure, although often in
causal inference we will use the words "intervention" or "treatment" to
talk about the exposure of interest.

## Explore the crude association between PPI and death

Now, ignoring the impact of any confounders just yet, let us estimate
the crude association between PPI and the risk of all-cause mortality.

First we calculate the proportion of deaths in the PPI and H2RA groups.
Then we obtain crude risk ratios for the association between PPI and
death.

```{r}

```

Question

Hand-calculate the risk ratio and risk difference for mortality,
comparing the PPI group to the H2RA group. Interpret the results. Do the
estimated risk ratio and risk difference indicate a causal effect of
PPIs on mortality?

### Standardization

We can obtain these same rates in a more convoluted way, via
standardisation, using a logistic regression model. Although there is no
reason to do this here, we will find this technique helpful later, so it
is useful to understand the process.

Simple standardization, which you may have previously encountered in the
form of age-standardization, is commonly applied to obtain marginal
causal effects from regression model outputs. In this case, we wish to
obtain the estimated risk of death in two hypothetical scenarios (i) one
in which every patient in our analysis dataset received a PPI
prescription, and (ii) one in which every patient in our analysis
dataset received a H2RA prescription.

To do this, using our model relating death to our exposure and potential
confounders, we will:

-   Obtain the mean estimated risk of all-cause mortality under the two
    hypothetical scenarios of every patient having PPI prescription and
    every patient having H2RA prescription.
-   Estimate the risk ratio for all-cause mortality comparing PPI and
    H2RA (by dividing the mean risk under PPI by the mean risk under
    H2RA) and the risk difference (by subtracting one risk from the
    other). We will only estimate the point estimates for now.

First, we fit our regression model for the outcome on exposure. Here,
this is simply a crude model including no other variables.

```{r}

```

Then we create two copies of the analysis dataset. In one, PPI
prescription is set to 1 (i.e. indicating every patient had a PPI
prescription). In the other dataset, PPI prescription is set to 0 (i.e.
indicating every patient had a H2RA prescription).

```{r}

```

Finally, we use the logistic regression model to predict the probability
of death in our two copies of the analysis data, with modified PPI
status. In the first, this estimates the probability of death if
everyone received a PPI prescription. In the second dataset, this
estimates the probability of death if everyone received a H2RA
prescription. These two probabilities are stored as variables in the
analysis dataset.

```{r}

```

You can use the `view(cinf_data$ppi_1)` command to look at the results.
What do you notice about the predictions? Why?

Finally, we take the mean of the two sets of predictions across the
sample. We divide one mean by the other to obtain the estimated risk
ratio and risk difference.

```{r}

```

Question

When looking at those estimates, how confident are we that these
represent causal effects? What could have influenced the estimates to
reflect non-causal relationships?

## Assess the assumptions required

We have a crude estimate for the relationship we are interested in. We
now consider the assumptions required to obtain a causal estimate.

### Consistency, SUTVA and positivity

We will explore the exchangeability (or no unmeasured confounding)
assumption later.

First, think about the other main assumptions: positivity (everyone in
our sample must have the possibility of being in either exposure group),
SUTVA (no interference) and consistency (no hidden variations of
treatment/exposure).

Question

For our specific question and dataset, how likely is it that these
assumptions hold? What specific violations of each assumption may have
occurred?

### Exchangeability

As discussed previously, age, sex, deprivation, calendar year and BMI
are likely to be key confounders of the relationship between PPI
prescription and subsequent all-cause mortality.

Draw a causal diagram for the association between PPI prescription and
all-cause mortality, considering if each covariate is a confounder, a
collider, or lies in the causal pathway between the exposure and
outcome. You can do that by hand or in Power Point or other software of
your choice. Include nodes for exposure, outcome, and the potential
confounders above. Add in any variable that you think affects any two
variables already in the diagram, whether or not they are measured in
our dataset.

Question

What does your causal diagram tell you about potential confounders? Do
you think there are important unmeasured confounders?

Having drawn a causal diagram, it is a good idea to check whether the
associations that you would expect to be present in your data really
are. For example, if your causal diagram has an arrow from BMI to all
cause mortality, then we would expect to see a difference in observed
risk of mortality according to BMI in our data.

#### Check whether potential confounders are associated with exposure

Having explored potential confounding through the causal diagram, we now
turn to the data and explore the extent to which the two exposure groups
are comparable to each other in terms of measured potential confounders.
Obviously, we are unable to do this for unmeasured variables.

We will first start with a simple description of the population we are
studying. Summarise covariates according to PPI prescription. You can
compute frequencies and proportions along with chi-squared values for
binary or categorical covariates/ For continuous covariates, obtain the
mean or median with standard errors or interquartile intervals,
respectively.

For example, for BMI (here we are summarizing the number, the mean and
the standard deviation in each PPI group):

```{r}

```

Question

Now that you have summarised the differences between the patients
prescribed PPI vs H2RA, what can you say about the comparability of the
groups in terms of the available covariates?

When working with large number of covariates, you can also generate a
table summarising covariates by exposure (or treatment) status. This can
include descriptive statistics, with or without hypothesis tests
comparing the two groups such as chi-squared or t-test. This is
sometimes called a "Table 1", since this type of table is often the
first table to appear in a publication exploring an exposure or
treatment effect. This can be done in R using the `tableone` command.

If you wish to try this, first install the `tableone` package (using the
command `install.packages("tableone")`). Load the package:

```{r}

```

Create lists containing all factor variables (so the package knows to
treat them as categorical variables, not continuous variables) and all
variables to be included in the table.

```{r}

```

Create Table 1 stratified by PPI:

```{r}

```

> Note: While these types of packages can increase efficiency of your
> workflow, don't be tempted to accept the output without thought. If
> you have a continuous varable, is the mean an appropriate summary
> statistic? If you add the automatcally generated p-values are the
> default tests applied appropriate to your situation? Etc.

#### Check whether potential confounders are associated with outcome

We now explore the relationship between each potential confounder (age,
sex, deprivation, calendar year and BMI) and death. For example, the
code below looks at age.

```{r}

```

Question

Having explored empirical relationships in the data, which variables do
you think are likely to be confounders? Which have the strongest
relationships with PPI prescription and death? Which covariates should
we account for in order to remove (observed) confounding?

## Account for observed confounders

We now fit a multivariable model to account for observed confounders.

```{r}

```

Question

Interpret the results. How do the adjusted estimates compare to the
crude? Do you think it is possible to say that this is the causal effect
of PPI on mortality? Why?

### Standardization

We use the standardisation approach explored earlier to obtain an
estimate of the risk ratio and risk difference of mortality, comparing
PPI and H2RA, after accounting for confounding by measured variables.

We have already created copies of the dataset in which every patient is
set (sometimes contrary to fact) to have received a PPI prescription,
and conversely in which every patient is set to have received a H2RA
prescription. We now apply the multivariable logistic regression model
we have just fitted to these datasets to obtain the required
predictions.

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

Question

Interpret the results. How do the risk difference and ratios compare to
the crude estimates above?

### [Optional] Obtaining confidence intervals for standardised estimates

Note that the standardization approach used above does not provide
standard errors. Therefore, we cannot obtain confidence intervals or
p-values, which limits usefulness of the estimates. In some cases,
packages exist which provide analytic standard errors (i.e. calculations
have been performed which have provided equations to estimate the
standard errors from the data at hand, which allows confidence intervals
to be calculated). If not, we often use *bootstrapping* to obtain
confidence intervals.

The R package `stdReg` allows us to obtain analytic confidence intervals
for standardised estimates following a range of regression models.
First, install the package (`install.packages("stdReg")`). Then load the
package:

```{r}

```

We have already fitted the relevant logistic regression model above.
Since logistic regression is a GLM, this task falls under the `stdGlm`
sub-command:

```{r}

```

The last two options above tell R to provide estimates under scenarios
where (i) the variable `ppi` is set entirely to the value 0, and (ii)
the variable `ppi` is set entirely to the value 1. We can then print out
the estimated risk difference:

```{r}

```

Or the estimated risk ratio:

```{r}

```

Question

Interpret the results. What does this output add to what we had
previously?

### [Optional] -- Explore the relationship between calendar time, BMI and mortality

In the practicals so far, you might have noticed that time of receiving
the PPI, or H2RA, prescription, is an important confounder. Similarly,
BMI seems to be an important confounder for the relationship between PPI
prescription and death. If you have time, you might want to explore a
little bit more by including square terms and interaction terms for
calendar time and BMI in your multivariable logistic model.

While we do not cover splines in this module, if you finish really early
you could explore how to add calendar time as a spline in your
multivariable logistic model!

## Summary

In this practical session we have explored the assumptions required to
make causal statements and discussed the extent to which these can be
tested. We have studied the main confounders for the relationship
between exposure and outcome, aiming to estimate the causal effect using
multivariable logistic regression. We expect that, by the end of this
practical, you will be able to:

-   Acknowledge the main assumptions required for causal inference and
    how they apply to your data.
-   Conduct data checks to explore measured confounding, and consider
    how the unconfoundedness assumption applies to your data after
    accounting for the available covariates.
-   Generate an estimate accounting for measured confounders, using
    logistic regression for the effect of a specific intervention (or
    exposure or treatment) on an outcome.

# Practical 7: Propensity scores

In this practical, we will continue to explore the relationship between
PPI prescription (exposure) and 5-year all-cause mortality (outcome) but
now using propensity score approaches. We will continue to ignore the
time-to-event aspect of the outcome variable and we will bring these two
elements together later in the module!

As previously, for simplicity we will also remove anyone with any
missing BMI data from our analysis dataset. In real life we would use a
range of techniques to handle the missing BMI data; for today's session,
however, we wish to focus our attention on the estimation of causal
effects.

## Read in data and packages

### Load packages

Install any of the following packages that you do not already have
installed: MatchIt, survey, cobalt, TableOne (using the command
`install.packages("")`). Then load the needed packages:

```{r}

```

### Read in data

Read in the analysis dataset, removing any patients with missing BMI
data:

```{r}

```

## Estimate the propensity score

As we described in the class earlier, the propensity score is defined as
the probability of exposure/treatment assignment conditional on measured
(or observed) characteristics. Our aim is to identify an exposed group
and a non-exposed group that are similar in terms of observed
characteristics, on average. To do that, for each individual, we
estimate their probability of being exposed (i.e. of having a
prescription for PPI rather than H2RA). Here, we use a a multiple
logistic regression model to estimate those probabilities.

First, we will fit a multiple logistic regression model for being
exposed to PPI:

```{r}

```

Using this model, we predict the probability of each individual being
exposed given their observed confounders/characteristics. We will save
these probabilities as a variable in the analysis dataset.

```{r}

```

After fitting the propensity score, it is important to investigate its
distribution!

Ideally, we do not want the propensity score to completely explain the
probability of being in the exposed or the unexposed group (i.e. we do
not want scores at zero or 1).If this does occur, this would indicate
that some individuals have almost no chance of being in the other
exposure group, which would violate the positivity assumption (which
states that each individual has a non-zero probability of being in
either exposure group).

Draw a histogram of the estimated propensity scores. Are there very
extreme propensity score values?

```{r}

```

Second, we wish to check that the range of propensity score values in
the two exposed groups overlaps. Such overlap is sometimes called
*common support*. A lack of common support (i.e. lack of overlap) would
also indicate a violation of the positivity assumption. For example, if
we have estimated propensity score values between 0.8 and 0.9 in the
exposed group but the highest propensity score in the unexposed group is
0.78, this would indicate that we have a set of people in the exposed
group who do not have anyone comparable to them in the unexposed group.

To explore the area of common support, you can use a histogram or plot a
box plot stratifying by PPI prescription.

```{r}

```

The R package `ggplot2` allows us to produce more sophisticated and
publishable graphs. Also, it allow us to plot the distribution of
propensity scores according to PPI prescription in the form of a
histogram. First, install the package (`install.packages("ggplot")`).
Then load the package:

```{r}

```

And produce a histogram of the propensity score according to PPI
prescription:

```{r}

```

Summarise the propensity score:

```{r}

```

Question

Based on the results above, how concerned are you about violations of
the positivity assumption?

## Assessing covariate balance

Assessing differences in the distribution of covariates between exposed
and non-exposed groups before incorporating any type of adjustment for
confounding is a key step to identify potential confounding (by measured
covariates). Here we will calculate, for each covariate, the
standardized difference (StD) between exposed and non-exposed groups. We
use StD instead of hypothesis testing because the StD is less influenced
by sample size. We will consider values of StD of over 0.1 to indicate
meaningful imbalance of that covariate between groups.

To calculate the standardized differences between two groups for
continuous variables we use the means and standard deviations of the
mean:

$$ 
StD=(mean_{exp} – mean_{unexp})/sd_{pool}
$$

where $mean_{exp}$ and $mean_{unexp}$ are the sample mean of the
covariate in the exposed and unexposed groups, respectively, and
"sd_pool" represents the standard deviation of the covariate in the
entire sample. There are various ways of obtaining an estimate of the
latter. We will calculated this from the sample standard deviations of
the covariate in the two groups ($sd_{exp}$ and $sd_{unexp}$} as:

$$
sd_{pool}=\sqrt{(sd_{exp}^2+sd_{unexp}^2)/2}
$$

Use this formula to calculate the standardised difference of age between
the PPI and the H2RA groups.

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

To calculate the standardized difference between two groups for
categorical variables we use proportions and standard deviations of
proportions:

$$
StD=(prop_{exp} – prop_{unexp})/sd_{pool}
$$

where $prop_{exp}$ and $prop_{unexp}$ are the sample proportion with the
characteristic of interest in the exposed and unexposed groups,
respectively, and $sd_{pool}$ can be calculated as:

$$
sd_{pool}=\sqrt{(prop_{exp}*(1-prop_{exp}) + prop_{unexp}(1-prop_{unexp}))/2}
$$

Use these formulae to calculate the standardised difference of gender
between the PPI and H2RA groups.

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

Alternatively, various R packages can calculate standardised differences
for you. For example, you can use the package `TableOne` to do this
using the `smd` option:

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

Question

What are the differences between the different ways of obtaining the
standardised differences?

How balanced are the covariates between the PPI and H2RA groups? Which
covariates have most/least balance? Do the results indicate that the
relationship between PPI and mortality is confounded?

## Propensity score weighting

After estimating the propensity scores, we can use these values to mimic
the two hypothetical scenarios in which (i) all individuals were exposed
(i.e. every person received a PPI prescription), and (ii) no individual
was exposed (i.e. every person received a H2RA prescription). In each of
these two hypothetical scenarios, the distribution of covariates
reflects the distribution of covariates seen in the whole sample.
Therefore, we expect that the covariates will be balanced if we compare
between these two hypothetical scenarios.

We mimic this situation by using the estimated propensity scores to
weight both exposure groups to reflect the population average
distribution of covariates in our sample. Comparing the outcomes among
these two weighted samples will then estimate the *Average Treatment
Effect*, ATE.

Alternatively, we can weight just the unexposed group so they have the
same distribution of covariates as in the exposed group. This compares
the observed scenario where exposed people are exposed with the
hypothetical scenario in which those same exposed people had instead not
been exposed. Comparing outcomes between these two scenarios will
instead estimate the *Average Treatment Effect on the Treated*, ATT.

### Deriving the ATE and ATT weights

We begin by using the estimated propensity scores to derive ATT and ATE
weights.

```{r}

```

We summarise the weights to check for extreme weights:

```{r}

```

### Assessing covariate balance in the weighted sample

The key diagnostic criterion in propensity score approaches is whether,
after accounting for the propensity score, the balance of the (measured)
confounding variables between exposed and unexposed groups has been
achieved. To verify if the adjustments were satisfactory, we estimate
the standardized differences of covariates between the two exposure
groups *after applying the weights*. We can do this by using the
`cobalt` package. (The `TableOne` package doesn't work on weighted
data).

First, apply the ATE weights and assess covariate balance.

```{r}

```

Repeat for the ATT weights.

```{r}

```

<b> Question </b>

Did the weighting improve the balance of the covariates? Did we achieve
balance for all the covariates?
:::

<br>

### Estimate the treatment effect

If we consider the weighted sample, where each individual is weighted by
the ATE weights that we have obtained, we should have balanced
covariates between the PPI and H2RA group. We can therefore simply
compare outcomes between the PPI and H2RA groups, assuming that the
weighting has removed (measured) confounding.

We can do this in a fairly manual manner, as follows. First, we separate
the dataset into the exposed (PPI) and unexposed (H2RA) groups. (We
don't really need to do this, but it makes the following lines of code
easier to read).

```{r}

```

Suppose we want to estimate the ATE. We then take the mean of the
outcome (`died`), weighting by the ATE weights. This involves
multiplying each individual's death status (`died`) by their weight
`ATEwg`, summing over the whole group, and dividing by the sum of the
weights.

```{r}

```

This tells us the estimated proportion of deaths in the PPI group and
the H2RA group. We can simply subtract one from the other, or divide
them, to estimate the risk difference and risk ratio.

```{r}

```

In practice, it is easier to do this calculation by using a regression
model. An advantage of doing so is that we obtain 95% confidence
intervals and p-values. We do this by fitting a model of outcome on
exposure, applying our weights to each individual. The model we use will
depend on the way we want to quantify the treatment effect. We would use
a logistic regression model to obtain an odds ratio, a GLM for binary
data with a log link to estimate the risk ratio and a GLM for binary
data with an identity link to estimate the risk different. To
incorporate weights in the regression models in R, we can use the
`survey` package.

To estimate the ATE, for example, we use the ATE weights as follows:

```{r}

```

And to estimate the ATT:

```{r}

```

Question

How similar the ATE and the ATT are? Why do you think this is the case?

## Propensity score adjustment

An alternative way of using propensity scores to account for (measured)
confounding is by simply including them in the regression as another
covariate. By adding the propensity score as a continuous variable in a
multiple logistic regression we estimate the average treatment effect.

### Incorporate the propensity score in the regression as a simple adjustment

```{r}

```

Although people often use the treatment (or exposure) coefficient as the
estimate of the treatment effect, it is better to use standardisation.
The reason for this is that using standardisation we can obtain the risk
difference or risk ratio, which can be more clearly tied to causal
contrasts than the odds ratio from the model above. As in the previous
session, we create two variables indicating that everyone is exposed
(`ppi_yes`) and no-one is exposed (`ppi_no`).

```{r}

```

We use our propensity-score-adjusted model to obtain the predicted
probability of experiencing the outcome for each individual under each
of the hypothetical scenarios:

```{r}

```

Then we take the mean of the two sets of predictions across the sample.
We divide one mean by the other to obtain the estimated risk ratio and
risk difference.

```{r}

```

We would typically then use the bootstrap to obtain a 95% confidence
interval. We will not do that now, since this can be quite a time
consuming process.

If you have time, explore how much the estimated risk ratio and risk
difference change if you add in an interaction between the propensity
score and PPI, and some non-linearities in the propensity score (e.g.
try adding a squared and cubed term).

```{r}

```

Question

How do these estimates compare to the ones obtained using weighting?

## [Optional] Propensity score matching

Finally, the most common application of propensity score methods is PS
matching. The default in matching is to estimate the ATE, but the
process can be modified to estimate the ATT. Checking balance and
visualisation of common support/overlap is very straightforward in PS
matching. There are many ways to create propensity score matched
samples. The choice depends partly on the treatment effect we are
interested in, whether common support/overlap holds, and the size of the
sample, among others. In this example we will:

-   Use the PS to match individuals -- we will use 1:1 nearest
    neighbouring matching with a maximum distance (caliper) of 0.1 (i.e.
    we will only allow two individuals to be declared a match if their
    propensity scores are within at most 0.1 of each other).
-   Check if the matching successfully selected a population of exposed
    and non-exposed who are comparable in terms of the observed
    covariates, You can use the standardised differences before and
    after matching to do this.
-   Estimate the ATT by fitting a univariable logistic regression to
    estimate the association between exposure (PPI) and outcome (died)
    in the matched sample.

First, we will use the package `MatchIt` to perform the matching.This
command may take a few minutes to run.

```{r}

```

Question

Look at the bottom of the output. How many individuals are in the
matched sample in each exposure group? Why is this a problem?

We then extract the matched dataset. This removes individuals who were
not matched.

```{r}

```

Have a look at the matched dataset. Make sure it contains the number of
people that you expect!

To assess whether the matching has produced good balance of the
covariates we can estimate the standardised differences in the matched
sample.

```{r}

```

Alternatively, we can use the `TableOne` package.

```{r}

```

To estimate the ATT we can fit a logistic regression in the matched
dataset:

```{r}

-   Describe the benefits of applying a propensity score approach\
-   Critically reflect on the differences between ATT and ATE
-   Estimate the ATT and ATE using a range of propensity score methods
-   Perform various checks of assumptions, including
    -   Investigate violations of the positivity assumption
    -   Explore covariate balance, before and after applying a
        propensity score method

# Practical 8: Self controlled case series

This analysis practical focuses on self-controlled study designs,
specifically the Self-Controlled Case Series (SCCS) design.

**Acknowledgement**: Very grateful thanks to Ian Douglas, Adrian Root
and Kate Mansfield (LSHTM) who provided data and code for this
practical.

## The data

This practical uses data originally made available by Professor Paddy
Farrington and Dr Heather Whitaker from the Open University. The data
have been altered slightly to mimic the format of data you may obtain
from a database of electronic health records.

The research question that we will consider is discussed in detail in:
Whitaker HJ, Farrington CP, Spiessens B, Musonda P. Tutorial in
biostatistics: the self-controlled case series method. Statistics in
Medicine. 2006,25(10):1768-97. We have provided you with this reference
on Moodle. Read Section 3.1 to familiarise yourself with the research
qestion.

In short, the question is about whether the measles mumps and rubella
vaccine (MMR) is associated with an increased risk of viral meningitis.
The data for a series of 10 patients are available for this analysis.

Download the data you have been provided with from Moodle.

| Variable  |  Format   | Description                        |
|-----------|:---------:|------------------------------------|
| patid     | numerical | Patient's identifier               |
| dob       | numerical | Date of birth                      |
| indexdate | numerical | Start of follow up                 |
| endFU     | numerical | End of follow up                   |
| eventdate | numerical | date of viral meningitis diagnosis |
| exday     | numerical | date of MMR vaccine administration |

### Explore the data

As usual, we will load tidyverse.

```{r}

```

Read in the data and reformat all dates as date variables (you will find
the command `as.Date(varname, "%d/%m/%Y")` helpful for this). Print out
the first few rows of the dataset.

```{r}

```

Check dates have been imported correctly (e.g. using the command
`class(sccs_data$dob)`). Have a look at the data. How many infants
developed viral meningitis between 15 and 35 days after receiving the
vaccine? Which ones (i.e. what are their patient IDs)? Does this agree
with the impression you got from the figure above?

```{r}

```

In order to analyse the data you will need to reformat it so that every
time a patient moves from one age group to the next or from one risk
state to the next, a new line of data is generated. Although this sounds
relatively simple, the programming involved can be complex. This example
is relatively straightforward but will illustrate the general process.

### Start and end of follow-up

Throughout we will create a variable called `type`, which will tell us
what type of cut-point we are thinking about (a start or end date for
follow-up, a change in age bands, or change between at-risk periods). We
will use the following codes for follow-up dates: type=1 (date of start
of follow-up), type=2 (date of end of follow-up).

First, keep only the patient ID, start and end of follow-up variables
and rename the last two `date1` and `date2`, respectively.

```{r}

```

Now use the `gather` function to "reshape" the data. In other words,
rather than having one row per person, with two date variables (the
start and end of follow-up), we will change to a dataset with two rows
per person and one date variable (called `date`), containing the start
date in the first of that person's data rows and the end in the second.

Also, create a `type` variable, containing the value 1 to indicate that
the row contains the start date and 2 to indicate an end date.

```{r}

```

Compare the two datasets `startend_dates` and `startend` to make sure
you understand the connection between the two.

### Start and end of "at-risk" periods

The risk period is assumed to start 15 days after exposure to the MMR
vaccine and to end 35 days after (inclusive). For our `type` variable,
we will use the codes: type=3 (15 days post-vaccine, start at-risk
period), type=4 (36 days post-vaccine, first day of no longer being
at-risk.

First, keep only the date of vaccine for the 10 patients and create
dates reflecting 15 and 36 days later.

```{r}

```

Now use the `gather` function to put the two dates for each person in a
single date variable (called `date`). In addition, create a `type`
variable, containing the value 3 for the start of the at-risk period and
the value 4 for the start of the subsequent not-at-risk period.

```{r}

```

## Age-bands

There are two age bands of interest, from 1 year to 18 months and from
18 months to 2 years (remember children only enter the study at 1 year
old). Using similar code to the above, create a dataset with two lines
per person, one (type=5) with the date a person becomes 18 months old
(547 days) and the other (type=6) with the date a person becomes two
years old (730 days).

```{r}

```

### Put the data together

Now we will append the three datasets above (`startend`, `risk`, `age`),
to create a dataset with one date variable for the different cut-points.
For each person, sort the data according to the dates at which the
relevant cut-points occur (i.e. sort by `patid` and `date`). We will add
in the dates of birth, in order to calculate the age at the cut-point
associated with the current line of data (`age_at_cutpoint`), and the
date of the next cut-point (`age_next_cutpoint`).

```{r}

```

Look at the data for one patient to make sure you understand how the
data are structured:

```{r}

```

Now we will create a variable indicating the age-band that the person
belongs to in each line of their data. In the line of data with the
cut-point noting the person has reached 18+ months, and any subsequent
lines of data (remember, data are sorted by `patid` and `date`) the
person will be in the older age-group (18-24 months). We will create a
variable `ageband` taking value 1 before the person is 18 months and 2
when they are 18+ months.

```{r}

```

For the at-risk periods, we wish to indicate that a person is at risk in
the line of data at which they reach 15 days post-vaccine. They remain
at risk in any rows of data up until their first day of being no-longer
at risk (36 days post-vaccine).

One way of doing this is to create the cumulative sum (within a person)
of the rows of data that they are at risk, and the cumulative sum of the
rows of data where they no longer at risk. Any rows of data in which
they qualify as "at-risk" and not "no longer at risk", we will allocate
them a value of 1 for our new variable `exgr` and 0 otherwise.

```{r}

```

Now we will remove any intervals (rows of data) which occur after a
person's end of follow-up. We will also remove any rows of data with
zero length (i.e. where the age is the same at the start of one row of
data and the next).

```{r}

```

### Events

Now we will add in the data regarding the outcome event, diagnosis of
viral meningitis. We will merge this date into our current dataset and
calculate the age in days at which the event occurred.

```{r}

```

Now we create a variable indicating rows in which an event occurred.

```{r}

```

## Fit mixed Poisson regression

We now have a dataset ready for analysis. Before fitting our regression
model, we will tell `R` to treat the risk=period variable and age-band
variables as factor variables. The command we will use also needs our
patient identifier to be a factor.

```{r}

```

We will include the log of the interval time as an offset variable.

```{r}

```

We will use a package called `gnm` to fit our conditional Poisson
regression model. You will need to install the package first, using:
`install.packages("gnm")`. Load the package.

```{r}

```

Once you have done that, fit a conditional Poisson regression model
including at-risk periods and age-bands as exposure variables. The
syntax of the code is quite similar to standard GLMs using `glm`. We
need to tell R that we want the family to be Poisson and the link to be
the log-link. And, as usual, we need to specify the dataset.

We will include the log of the interval as an offset variable. This is
the same as in standard Poisson regression. Forcing the log of the
interval into the regression model with coefficient set to 1 (which is
what an offset does) takes account of the fact that we expect more
events to occur in longer intervals of time and fewer in shorter
intervals of time. We do this, in practice, by adding
`offset(name_of_offset_var)` to the linear predictor.

We will condition on the patient and include the log of the interval as
an offset variable. This type of conditioning is not something we have
studied. We can think of this as taking account of the fact that two
bits of time from the same person will be more similar than two bits of
time from different people, in terms of their likelihood of experiencing
the event during that bit of time. In practice, we do this by adding the
option `eliminate=patid`.

```{r}

```

The output is easiest to interpret on the incidence rate ratio scale.

```{r}

```

Question

What is the interpretation of the output from this regression model?
What should we conclude about the relationship between the MMR vaccine
and diagnosis of viral meningitis?

## Summary

In this practical session we have explored the steps needed in practice
to create an analysis-ready dataset for a self-controlled case series
study design. The key messages that we hope you will take from this are:

-   Creating the analysis dataset needs careful thought about
    overlapping periods and cut-points within individuals
-   The analysis itself is relatively straightforward once the design
    and data manipulation have been completed
